## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Windows Power Toolkit, 
please report it responsibly by opening an issue marked [SECURITY] on the GitHub repository 
or by contacting me directly via Discord at Iaxivers.

When reporting:

    Provide a clear description of the issue and how to reproduce it.

    Suggest possible fixes or workarounds if you have any.

I typically respond to security reports within 1-2 business days. 
If the issue is confirmed, I’ll work on a patch and release an update as soon as possible. 
You’ll be credited unless you request otherwise.
